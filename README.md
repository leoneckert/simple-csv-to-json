# simple-csv-to-json
simple python script to convert a .csv file with a header line to a .json file.<br>
there might be some small corrections to be made depending on the input file (thinking of different uses of ```"```), so be alert.<br>
other than that, call it this way:<br>
```$ python csv_to_json.py inputfile outputfile```
